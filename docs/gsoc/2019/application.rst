Synfig GSoC application (draft) 2019
------------------------------------

**Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?**

We would like to allow our student contributors to dedicate their full time to work on Synfig during summer 2019.

**How many potential mentors have agreed to participate?**

2

**How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?**

The student opens GitHub's issue, which is coresponding to his project and there provides weekly public reports about his progress. Every mentor should follow reports and provide on-time feedback and advices to student via public discussion in relevant GitHub's issue or privately via email.

Administrator of the project also watches reports and ensures that feedback provided by mentors on time.

**How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?**

Every student is required to write a short report about his progress every week, answering those questions:

- How was the last week? What did you accomplish?
- What is the #1 thing slowing you down?
- What do you want to have done by the end of next week?

**How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?**

...

**How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?**

Considering that there are no mechanics to 100% guarantee student involvement after the program, we aim to create a community with a special attitude, where a student can have a home-like feeling, where he know his work is valued and appreciated by community other members and creative people from all around the world. This is the main motivation to contribute for all current project members.

Given that we put initial student motivation in the first place, we understand that there are situations where a massive and long-term contribution effort it not possible without monetary reward. So, thanks to a regular income of donations we can afford to pay a small grants for implementing some features, for students who proven their abilities and skill to carry and complete projects. The money for such grants are collected via continuous crowdfunding and other means (see https://www.synfig.org/donate/ for details).

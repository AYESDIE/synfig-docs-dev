List of hotkeys:
====================

Little description:

As for developer there is a reason to split global hotkeys and content-aware hotkeys.
They will have different implementation, so we need a place to check is any
conflicts between hotkeys. Also in the future this will be part of user 
documentation.

Global hotkeys:
----------------


==============  ===============
Hotkey            Action
==============  ===============
Ctrl+N           New
Ctrl+O           Open
Ctrl+S           Save
Shift+Ctrl+S     Save as...
Ctrl+I           Import
F11              Preview
F9               Render
Ctrl+W           Close document
Ctrl+Q           Quit
==============  ===============

That is strange, because *CommonMarkup* renders this text correctly, but Spinx is not.  
Will try to check this later.
